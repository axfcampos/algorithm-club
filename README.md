Algorithm Club
==============

Let's solve a new code challenge every week, you get to pick your language :)

# How does this work

Every week we set up a challenge for next week (it can be on hackerrank, any code puzzle book etc), participants develop a solution using the language they prefer during the week and they we meet at Saturday to discuss the solution (no worries if someone didn't manage to reach one, the goal is to learn).

# Challenges
